			<p>
			Hotel.com Naran was established in 2000 in the heart of Naran.Before us, the standard of hospitality services was low and the facilities provided were very few. Millennium Inn raised the bar and for the first time provided all luxurious facilities in Naran. Being the first 4 star hotel of the town. We have best rooms available at affordable rates and a 5 star restaurant. Our customers are always satisfied and happy with our hospitality.

For us “Hospitality is simply an opportunity to show love and care”.
